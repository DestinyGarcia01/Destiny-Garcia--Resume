        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Destiny Garcia. I was born and raised in Orange County, California. I grew up in a Hispanic family and ever since I was a child my parents taught me to be hardworking and determined. Throughout my educational years from preschool to high school, Iâ€™ve earned very good grades and high GPAâ€™s. Of course, my journey wasnâ€™t easy, especially going to a charter high school. They were completely different from a normal high school because they had very high expectations. They prepared us for college by giving many homework assignments, tests, and college courses as well. Now, Iâ€™m in the University of California, Riverside and I couldnâ€™t be more thankful for this great opportunity. I know this environment is going to be more challenging but Iâ€™m excited to test my skills and continue working towards my degree in sociology. 
<br><br>
        School was not the only thing I focused on. Ever since I was twelve years old I grew interested in baking. It all started when I began watching the Netflix series, Cake Boss. Buddy Valastro, the head baker, would recreate these amazing cakes that didnâ€™t even seem real! I would imagine myself in his shoes up until I convinced my mom to sign me up for some classes. I took 8 courses in total, and they were very basic. They included how to frost a cake, how to decorate a cake, how to pipe, how to create flowers, etc. I know many of the girls in that class didnâ€™t believe in me since I was the youngest of them all. However, I continued pushing forward and practiced at home over the years. In 2017, I opened up my social media pages and began selling cakes to the people around my city. Itâ€™s now 2020 and my bakery has been a complete success. Iâ€™ve made wedding cakes, quinceanera cakes, baptism, gender reveal, and so many fun birthday cakes. I always feel honored being asked to make special cakes because I know customers are giving me their trust and itâ€™s my job to satisfy them. My business has also opened up many opportunities in my life, and many of the adults around me are surprised to see a young adult have so much determination. 
<br><br>
        Besides school and my baking business, I enjoy painting and playing soccer. Overall, I am a normal girl like everyone else. I have four english bulldogs and one frenchie. My family consists of a total of five people including myself. I'm the oldest, which is not so great at times since I have more responsibilities. My younger siblings look up to me as their role model which is why I continue trying my best so I could give them a good example. Three years ago I had to get my appendix removed through surgery. This was the first time I ever went through that process and it was very scary but thankfully, everything turned out smoothly. Despite all the challenges I have faced in these past few years, I will always strive to do my best in school and at home.
